## Graph Convolutional Networks

The notebooks in this folder are used to train and evaluate our graph convolutional models.
- `TrainGCNs.ipynb` contains code to create and train GCNs for various chemical properties. The weights for the trained models generated by this file can be found in the `gcnmodels` folder.
- `EdgeCondDemo.ipynb` contains an interactive demonstration file that lets the user query properties from the QM9 dataset and compare the runtimes for DFT and neural methods.
