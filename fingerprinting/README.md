## Molecular Fingerprinting and Message Passing Networks

These features are still in development. Ultimately, we hope to use molecular fingerprinting tools, available from cheminformatics software RDKit to allow us to generalize our networks to arbitrary-sized inputs. 
- `Fingerprints.ipynb` contains an exploration of RDKit's fingerprinting tools.

The other files include a local copy of a message-passing neural network (MPNN) implementation, cloned from [DeepChem contrib](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/tree/master/contrib/mpnn), and our attempts to port and test it in into Python 3.
